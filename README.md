## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 1. The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are mpg, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance. You can see this from the data due to the P-values being below 0.05 which is our 95% confidence level of significance
 2. The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero. There are only two values near zero, vehicle_weight and spoiler_angle which are .001 and .069 respectively. The other values are greater than or less than one, which can not lead to a slope of zero.
 3. According to the data that we are aloted, this data set is an effective Linear model for predicting MPG of MechaCar protoypes. The R squared value is .71 which is a good output for our data. There could however be more relevant data and this could very well be a case of overfitting.
