## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 1. The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are mpg, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance. You can see this from the data due to the P-values being below 0.05 which is our 95% confidence level of significance
 2. The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero. There are only two values near zero, vehicle_weight and spoiler_angle which are .001 and .069 respectively. The other values are greater than or less than one, which can not lead to a slope of zero.
 3. According to the data that we are aloted, this data set is an effective Linear model for predicting MPG of MechaCar protoypes. The R squared value is .71 which is a good output for our data. There could however be more relevant data and this could very well be a case of overfitting.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
 1. The design specifications for the MEchaCar susprension coils variance required to not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The manufacturing data meets these specifications for all manufactorings lots in total, but does not meet for each lot individually. Specifically, lot 3 is producing a variance of 170.2
